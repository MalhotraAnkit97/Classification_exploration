# Classification_exploration
This repository and the jupyter notebook is for the exploration i have performed in classification algorithms

As for classification, it's obvious that classification models try to find patterns and trends in a dataset, and try to cluster / classify them into groups. 

This classification ofcourse happens in more than one ways, and in this jupyter notebook, I have explored and established a few ways of the different ways in which classification happens. 

Enjoy!
